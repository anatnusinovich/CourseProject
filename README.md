Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repo includes the submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 

Dataset- Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Included files- 
1. CodeBook.md- a code book describing the steps to cleaning the data including the variables, the data, and the transformations.

2. run_analysis.R- the code that performs the data preparation and the five steps required by the assignment:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. FinalData.txt- final tidy data after all the steps.
